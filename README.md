## Code Overview

### `App.js`

- The main component of the application.
- Manages state for location, locationName, weather, and loading status.
- Uses the `useEffect` hook to fetch weather data when the location state changes.
- Contains helper functions to get weather icons, convert country codes to flags, and format dates.

### Helper Functions

- `getWeatherIcon(wmoCode)`: Returns a weather icon based on the WMO code.
- `convertToFlag(countryCode)`: Converts a country code to a flag emoji.
- `formatDay(dateStr)`: Formats a date string to a short weekday name.

## API Usage

- The app uses the [Open Meteo Geocoding API](https://geocoding-api.open-meteo.com/) to convert location names to geographical coordinates.
- The [Open Meteo Weather API](https://api.open-meteo.com/) is used to fetch weather data based on these coordinates.

## Deployment

To build the app for production, run:
```sh
npm run build
```
or
```sh
yarn build
```
This will create an optimized production build in the `build` directory.
